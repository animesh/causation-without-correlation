MINIMAL EXAMPLE: CAUSATION WITHOUT CORRELATION

[EXAMPLE 1] A Sine Wave with State-Dependent Damping

Correlation: ρ = 0.0359 (NOT SIGNIFICANT)
p-value: 0.7522

✓ PROOF OF CAUSATION:
  When Gene A = +0.9: Gene B = 0.934 (HIGH - damping!)
  When Gene A ≈ 0.0:  Gene B = 0.091 (LOW - no damping)

[EXAMPLE 2] The Pendulum Checkpoint

Correlation: ρ = 0.5984 (essentially zero!)
p-value: 0.0000

✓ PROOF OF CAUSATION:
  When SWI4 wants up (sin>0.5): WHI5 = 0.499
  When SWI4 is down (sin<-0.5): WHI5 = 0.001

[EXAMPLE 3] The Micro-Scale Example

Data:
  X = [-1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  Y = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

Correlation: ρ = 0.0000
Causation: Y = |X|  (OBVIOUS!)

KEY INSIGHT:
- Correlation assumes linearity; causal relationships can be nonlinear and state-dependent.
- Use CCM for detecting state-dependent, nonlinear causation.
