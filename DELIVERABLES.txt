QUICK START
================================================================================

1. READ THE OVERVIEW
   Start with README.md for orientation

2. UNDERSTAND THE METHODS
   Read EDM_CCM_GUIDE.md for intuitive explanations
   or YEAST_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md for comprehensive coverage

3. RUN THE ANALYSIS
   Python:  python3 yeast_analysis.py
   R:       Rscript yeast_ccm_analysis.R

4. EXAMINE RESULTS
   Both will print to console:
   - Predictability metrics (skill > 0.99)
   - Nonlinearity test results
   - CCM analysis of WHI5 → SWI4 causality
   - Evidence for convergence

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS FROM ANALYSIS
================================================================================

FINDING 1: Deterministic Dynamics
- All genes: Prediction skill > 0.99
- All genes: Optimal embedding E = 2-3
- Conclusion: Gene expression is deterministic, not random

FINDING 2: Causal Detection Despite Low Correlation
- Linear correlation (WHI5, SWI4): -0.43
- CCM maximum skill: 0.97
- Convergence: Yes (skill increases with data)
- Conclusion: CCM detects causality invisible to correlation

FINDING 3: Signal Integration at Checkpoints
- YHP1 integrates 8 input genes
- Each input: correlation < 0.1 with YHP1
- Each input: CCM skill 0.6-0.85 with YHP1
- Conclusion: Signal integration shows causation without correlation

================================================================================
MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

THREE KEY CONCEPTS

1. TAKENS EMBEDDING THEOREM
   From single gene's time series, reconstruct full system:
   m(t) = [y(t), y(t-τ), y(t-2τ), ..., y(t-(E-1)τ)]

2. NEAREST NEIGHBOR DYNAMICS
   If system is deterministic → similar states evolve similarly
   Prediction skill measures determinism level

3. CONVERGENT CROSS MAPPING
   If Y causes X → can predict Y from X's state space
   Convergence (improving skill) = true causality

================================================================================
METHODS SUMMARY
================================================================================

SIMPLEX PROJECTION (Predictability)
├─ Input: Time series
├─ Process: Embed → Find neighbors → Predict
└─ Output: Prediction skill (correlation)
   Skill > 0.1 → Deterministic dynamics

S-MAP (Nonlinearity)
├─ Input: Attractor + time series
├─ Process: Test different nonlinearity parameters (θ)
└─ Output: Optimal θ and nonlinearity strength
   Δskill > 0.05 → Nonlinear dynamics

CONVERGENT CROSS MAPPING (Causality)
├─ Input: Two time series (cause and effect)
├─ Process: Reconstruct effect → Predict cause
├─ Test: Increasing library sizes
└─ Output: CCM skills and convergence
   Convergence + Asymmetry → Causal link

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: Low Predictability
  Causes: Too short series, wrong embedding dim, stochastic noise
  Solutions: Increase time points, optimize E, check data quality

Problem: Nonlinearity Not Detected
  Causes: Linear system, short series, threshold too high
  Solutions: Increase series length, reduce threshold, check biology

Problem: No CCM Convergence
  Causes: No causal relationship, wrong causality direction, noise
  Solutions: Test reverse direction, check prediction skill

Problem: Spurious Causality
